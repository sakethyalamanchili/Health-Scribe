CLINICAL NOTES - Current Visit (11/12/2024)
--------------------------------------------
SUBJECTIVE:
Patient presents for follow-up, accompanied by son Mark. Patient states she feels "pretty good for 80" but admits to "feeling more wobbly" and is fearful of falling again, especially after a minor fall 2 weeks ago (tripped on rug, no injury). Son, Mark, expresses concern about her short-term memory, noting she missed 2-3 medication doses last week and has been asking repetitive questions. Patient denies chest pain, SOB, or dizziness. Reports knee stiffness, managed with Tylenol.

OBJECTIVE:
Alert and pleasant 80-year-old female. Vitals stable, BP at goal. EKG shows A-fib, rate 74. Cardiovascular: Irregularly irregular rhythm, 1/6 systolic murmur. Respiratory: Clear. Extremities: 1+ pedal edema bilaterally (chronic). Gait: Slow, uses a single-point cane, slightly unsteady on turns. MOCA score 24/30, down from 27/30 last year.

ASSESSMENT:
1. Atrial Fibrillation: Chronic, stable, rate-controlled, anticoagulated.
2. Hypertension: Well-controlled on Amlodipine.
3. Osteoporosis: High-risk, on appropriate therapy (Prolia).
4. Mild Cognitive Impairment: New finding, likely progressing. Son's report of missed medications is a concern.
5. High Fall Risk: Secondary to osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, unsteady gait, and possible cognitive changes.
6. Osteoarthritis: Chronic, stable, managed with Acetaminophen.

PLAN:
1. Cognitive Decline: MOCA score and son's report are concerning.
    - Start Vitamin B12 1000mcg daily supplement (level is low-normal).
    - Discussed 7-day pill organizer box, son will set this up.
    - Formal referral to Neurology for cognitive assessment and to rule out reversible causes.
2. Fall Risk:
    - Referral to Physical Therapy (PT) for balance training and gait assessment.
    - Discussed home safety evaluation (removing throw rugs, adding grab bars).
3. Medications:
    - Continue all current medications. Emphasized importance of adherence, especially Apixaban (Eliquis) for stroke prevention.
    - Administer Prolia injection in-office today (due 02/2025, *Correction: Not due today, next due 02/2025. Will schedule*).
4. Follow-up: Re-check in 3 months. Call sooner if any additional falls or acute cognitive changes.

PATIENT EDUCATION:
- Reviewed fall prevention strategies with patient and son.
- Emphasized importance of medication adherence using a pill box.
- Discussed MOCA results and plan for neurology referral.
