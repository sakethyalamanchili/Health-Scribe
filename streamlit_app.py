        - **Clinical Prioritization:** Reasoning about medical urgency.
        - **Self-Correction:** An agent must review and validate its own "fuzzy" assessments.
        - **Semantic Understanding:** Merging "flu shot" and "influenza vaccine".
        - **Evidence-Based Reasoning:** RAG with medical guidelines.
